# Reproduce the initial breakthrough discriminators

Use the canonical `hipotures/rad` repository on branch
`research/integer-mult-breakthrough-20261008`. On the CPU host, the isolated
worktree is `/home/user/DEV/rad-breakthrough`. The old CPU branch is read-only
reference material and must not be used for active development.

All commands below run from the worktree root. Standard-library Python 3.11+
and Git suffice for these retained checks; they need no network, dataset, GPU,
machine-local historical checkout or installed solver.

```sh
python3 tools/run_ci.py --group smoke --all
python3 tools/run_ci.py --group certificates --all
```

The registry records every effective local code/fixture dependency and claim
scope. The finite checks reject corrupted unitarity, incomplete moment mass,
signed work charges, zero potentials, unpaid normalization and degree capacity.
CI verifies those controls, not a multiplication algorithm or larger kappa.

To regenerate the complete initial discriminators, choose a NEW ignored or
external path for each output. Do not replace prior attempts.

```sh
python3 -B research/integer-mult-breakthrough/code/obstructions/unitary_dyadic.py --self-test
python3 -B research/integer-mult-breakthrough/code/obstructions/unitary_dyadic.py --workers 4 --max-row-power 7 --max-butterfly-power 5 --output research/integer-mult-breakthrough/work/REPRO-UNIQUE/unitary/results.json
python3 -B research/integer-mult-breakthrough/code/obstructions/wider_unitary.py
python3 -B research/integer-mult-breakthrough/code/transfers/coupled_moments.py --workers 4 --cases 96 --output research/integer-mult-breakthrough/work/REPRO-UNIQUE/mixing/results.json
python3 -B research/integer-mult-breakthrough/code/transfers/deferred_normalization.py --workers 4 --cases 96 --output research/integer-mult-breakthrough/work/REPRO-UNIQUE/normalization/results.json
```

Expected outcomes: exhaustive dyadic row classifications and exact finite
Gram matrices pass; complete frozen moments at saving 1e-4 remain greater
than one; finite carry interfaces change the spectrum while the paid
redundant/padding controls recover their stated integer values. Timing and
interpreter strings vary and are not scientific claims.

The coordinator reviewed the positive-matrix minimum-potential proof and
independently ran the bounded transfer checks. A separate synthesis agent
reviewed the dyadic row descent and unitary scope. The raw initial four-worker
evidence is packed into this topic's evidence namespaces without altering
originals. Run protocols, compact summaries and source hashes distinguish
retained finite evidence from analytical assumptions.

The full mathematical motivation and limitations are in the linked reports.
Primary literature and framework provenance are pinned in input-manifest.json;
no downloaded source modifications are required to run these new checks.
